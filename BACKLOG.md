## Now (blocking or next up)

- **SEAT-6** Grok seat integration is incomplete (AgentBeast-owned, engram
  needs no change). Grok already carries `ENGRAM_PROVIDER` — the roster and
  AB's enumeration both report `provider=grok` correctly (AB fixed the
  enumeration in `b82860a`). What remains: grok gets no `ENGRAM_SESSION_KEY`
  on AB's launch *start* path, so a grok seat has no stable key across a
  respawn (grok effort/model changes stop→respawn), meaning it can't reliably
  re-claim the same seat the way Claude does. Not an engram instability and no
  regression — grok works today on its launch-injected identity.

- **SEAT-4** Roster lifecycle (registry Phase 2). Presence rows are never
  released: the live roster carries entries days stale, all still reporting
  `state: running`, because self-reported state is never corrected once a
  session dies. Mark entries past grace `presumed-dead` and let the cleanup
  task drop rows past a retention horizon.

- **DR-3** Consider enabling WAL archiving. Recovery granularity today is
  "the last dump" — `archive_mode=off`, so there is no point-in-time
  recovery and anything written since the last dump is unrecoverable.
  Decide whether the operational cost is worth closing that window.

## Needs decision

- **MEM-2** Key-prefix enumeration — a deterministic "list every key under
  `wip/`" that returns ALL matches in key order with no embedding involved.
  `memory_get` is exact-match, `memory_search` is semantic, and there is
  nothing in between; measured live, handoff notes score 0.51 while an
  unrelated five-month-old note scores 0.45, so "read all the open handoffs"
  is not reliably expressible and a missing one is indistinguishable from
  none. Would honor namespace read perms exactly as search does. Requested by
  AgentBeast 2026-07-24. **Justified today, independent of any multi-session
  design** — sibling `wip/*` keys have sat unread for weeks in a
  single-session world because `/startup` fetches exact keys and everything
  else is invisible by construction. What the owner's handoff direction gates
  is this item's PRIORITY, not its validity.

- **MEM-3** A lifecycle verb for memories — resolve/supersede, copying the
  inbox's existing pattern rather than inventing one (same table, same
  metadata status field; a row with no status reads as live, so it is
  back-compatible). Today memories have only create and delete, so the sole
  way to stop stale handoffs accumulating is `memory_forget`, which destroys
  the history. "Delete is the only lifecycle verb" is a shape worth removing
  after the 2026-07-23 incident. Same gate as MEM-2.

## Next (committed, not started)

- **DATA-1** Decide the fate of two sensitive local archives sitting
  untracked at `~/projects/` top level (deliberately outside every git
  repo, inside FleetBackup's source set): the 2026-07-23 inbox recovery
  export, and the older pre-rewrite history bundle. Both contain verbatim
  private conversation and neither is managed by any retention policy —
  they persist until someone decides. Owner's call: keep, relocate to a
  vault, or delete. Pointer: `shared:reference/inbox-recovery-archive-2026-07-23`.

- **DOC-8** Reference the shell-wrapper approach for seating
  hand-launched sessions once it exists (sets `ENGRAM_INBOX_IDENTITY` from
  folder + provider when unset, so a bare terminal session inherits a seat
  through the same process tree as a launcher-spawned one). Makes the
  strong path universal and demotes runtime seats to a convenience.
  Wrapper lives in the operator's shell config, not this repo.

- **NS-3** Retire the `claude-code=fleet` alias — SECOND attempt, now
  data-gated. NS-2's config/DB/grants sweep missed a straggler class:
  application clients hardcoding the legacy namespace in their own code
  (AB's hub, MEM-403). Alias restored as prod operator config;
  NAMESPACE-ALIAS-HIT logging added. Retire only after: AB's client
  switched to `fleet` AND the log is quiet for a full grace week.

## Blocked-external

- **DOCKER-1** Verify the full-stack compose path (build, health,
  store/search roundtrip), then promote it from "experimental" in
  README/deployment docs. Blocked: NO healthy Docker runtime exists on the
  fleet (surveyed 2026-07-21 — Linux spokes have no Docker; macmini's
  OrbStack hangs on daemon start). Needs a runtime repair or a fresh box
  first; the stack definition itself is unproven, not suspect.
