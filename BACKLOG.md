# engram — BACKLOG (open items only)

> Open work only. Done = delete the line (its story lives in the commit and in

## Now (blocking or next up)

## Next (committed, not started)

- **NS-3** Retire the `claude-code=fleet` alias — SECOND attempt, now
  data-gated. NS-2's config/DB/grants sweep missed a straggler class:
  application clients hardcoding the legacy namespace in their own code
  (AB's hub, MEM-403). Alias restored as prod operator config;
  NAMESPACE-ALIAS-HIT logging added. Retire only after: AB's client
  switched to `fleet` AND the log is quiet for a full grace week.

## Blocked-external

- **DOCKER-1** Verify the full-stack compose path (build, health,
  store/search roundtrip), then promote it from "experimental" in
  README/deployment docs. Blocked: NO healthy Docker runtime exists on the
  fleet (surveyed 2026-07-21 — Linux spokes have no Docker; macmini's
  OrbStack hangs on daemon start). Needs a runtime repair or a fresh box
  first; the stack definition itself is unproven, not suspect.

## Later / decide
